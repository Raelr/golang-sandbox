# golang-sandbox

This repository was created with the intention of being a simple sandbox for testing Golang. The project itself contains a number of separate 'projects' which use some of the basic features of Go. This is intended to be purely educational.

## Projects

So far, the sandbox contains two projects:

* helloworld
* cards

Each project's description can be found below:

### helloworld

Just a basic 'Hello World!' program for Go.

### cards

A program which tests arrays and slices by simulating a deck of cards. 

## Setup

Make sure you have Golang installed on your computer. If it isn't installed, you can download the full package from [golang.org](https://golang.org/). 

Simply clone the repository to your desired directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Raelr/golang-sandbox.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project that you wish to test and run the golang run command:

```
go run main.go <OTHER_.GO_FILES_IN_DIRECTORY>
```

This should hopefully run the go files for the project!

Enjoy!
